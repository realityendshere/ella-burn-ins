# Warning: This is a work in progress (WIP)

I accept friendly pull requests and feedback.

Also, use this addon at your own risk. It could be capable of anything, including scaring your cat (even if you don't own a cat) or burning your toast (nobody *really* likes burnt toast). Please use caution when using addons that are not yet complete.

# Emberella Burn Ins

A collection of handy helpers and mixins used by other Emberella addons.

# Installation

Ember and Ember CLI are always evolving, so you may wish to verify these instructions in the Ember CLI documentation. As of this writing, you can install this addon by navigating to your project directory in the command line and entering the following:

```bash
ember install ella-burn-ins
```

This will add the Emberella Burn Ins library as a dependency to your app.
